I Need Space To Dance by Boulderhead, released 31 May 2024

1. I Need Space (ft. Overnite Oates)
2. Dance and Dance Again
3. Direct Source
4. Saucy Hive Mind
5. Sense Hyper
6. Adapting (bandcamp exclusive)

Boulderhead debuts on Rhythm Section International with his most expansive EP to date: “ I Need Space to Dance”

The Bristol based producer, known for his intricately crafted, up tempo club records has long been a favourite at RS HQ and has, over the years, garnered much respect from a plethora of influential DJs. His most recent hit “ Bread, Butter, Noodles, Spice”, was a festival earworm and one of the most played underground tracks of 2023.

Existing in the sweet spot between tech-house, prog, broken beat and minimal techno - this EP sees Boulderhead widen his sonic palette with a collection of songs that showcase his versatility.

We are treated to contemplative, deep dubby moments (“Adapting”), glistening rollers ( “Saucy Hive Mind”) right through to the 146pm psychedelic tour-de-force of “ Sense Hyper”. 

Boulderhead - real name Henry James, doubles down on his trademark shuffly ‘spoken word - tech’ recipe with soon-to-be club favourite “I Need Space” featuring frequent collaborator Overnite Oates, who over the course of 6 minutes, demands space - to dance!

“Dance and Dance Again” expands on this format with more chopped vocals increasing the bounce per ounce.

Equally appealing to the Ricardo Villalobos contingent as it will be to those delving into the history of progressive house and the golden days of minimal techno - we think there’s a bit of something for everyone here. 

Despite the many different bases the EP touches on - the sound pallette and production are unified and coherent. Henry is at the top of his game, and much like contemporary artists like Adam Pits, Priori and Russell EL Butler - his style screams ALBUM!

Watch this space

Cute fact: it all started with a demo sent via bandcamp back in 2015 :)

His most recent hit “ Bread, Butter, Noodles, Spice”, was a festival earworm and one of the most played underground tracks of 2023.\r\n\r\nExisting in the sweet spot between tech-house, prog, broken beat and minimal techno - this EP sees Boulderhead widen his sonic palette with a collection of songs that showcase his versatility.\r\n\r\nWe are treated to contemplative, deep dubby moments (“Adapting”), glistening rollers ( “Saucy Hive Mind”) right through to the 146pm psychedelic tour-de-force of “ Sense Hyper”. \r\n\r\nBoulderhead - real name Henry James, doubles down on his trademark shuffly ‘spoken word - tech’ recipe with soon-to-be club favourite “I Need Space” featuring frequent collaborator Overnite Oates, who over the course of 6 minutes, demands space - to dance!\r\n\r\n“Dance and Dance Again” expands on this format with more chopped vocals increasing the bounce per ounce.\r\n\r\nEqually appealing to the Ricardo Villalobos contingent as it will be to those delving into the history of progressive house and the golden days of minimal techno - we think there’s a bit of something for everyone here. \r\n\r\nDespite the many different bases the EP touches on - the sound pallette and production are unified and coherent. Henry is at the top of his game, and much like contemporary artists like Adam Pits, Priori and Russell EL Butler - his style screams ALBUM!\r\n\r\nWatch this space\r\n\r\nCute fact: it all started with a demo sent via bandcamp back in 2015 :)&quot;,&quot;credits&quot;:&quot;Mastered by Kassian at Dubplates &amp;

            <div class="tralbumData tralbum-about">Boulderhead debuts on Rhythm Section International with his most expansive EP to date: “ I Need Space to Dance”<br>
<br>
The Bristol based producer, known for his intricately crafted, up tempo club records has long been a favourite at RS HQ and has, over the years, garnered much respect from a plethora of influential DJs. His most recent hit “ Bread, Butter, Noodles, Spice”, was a festival earworm and one of the most played underground tracks of 2023.<br>
<br>
Existing in the sweet spot between tech-house, prog, broken beat and minimal techno - this EP sees Boulderhead widen his sonic palette with a collection of songs that showcase his versatility.<br>
<br>
We are treated to contemplative, deep dubby moments (“Adapting”), glistening rollers ( “Saucy Hive Mind”) right through to the 146pm psychedelic tour-de-force of “ Sense Hyper”. <br>
<br>
Boulderhead - real name Henry James, doubles down on his trademark shuffly ‘spoken word - tech’ recipe with soon-to-be club favourite “I Need Space” featuring frequent collaborator Overnite Oates, who over the course of 6 minutes, demands space - to dance!<br>
<br>
“Dance and Dance Again” expands on this format with more chopped vocals increasing the bounce per ounce.<br>
<br>
Equally appealing to the Ricardo Villalobos contingent as it will be to those delving into the history of progressive house and the golden days of minimal techno - we think there’s a bit of something for everyone here. <br>
<br>
Despite the many different bases the EP touches on - the sound pallette and production are unified and coherent. Henry is at the top of his game, and much like contemporary artists like Adam Pits, Priori and Russell EL Butler - his style screams ALBUM!<br>
<br>

Cute fact: it all started with a demo sent via bandcamp back in 2015 :)</div>
